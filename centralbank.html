    Step 5 of 5 - Central bank
  </p>

<h2>What the central bank actually does</h2>

<p>
The central bank does not create money the way commercial banks do.
It operates on a different layer of the monetary system.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Two layers of money</h3>

<p>
Modern monetary systems have two distinct layers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bank deposits</strong> — used by households and firms</li>
  <li><strong>Central bank reserves</strong> — used only by banks</li>
</ul>

<p>
These layers are connected, but they are not the same thing.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Reserves are not deposits</h3>

  <div class="thought-box">
<pre>
CENTRAL BANK
------------------------
Liabilities:
• Bank reserves

COMMERCIAL BANK
------------------------
Assets:
• Reserves at central bank
Liabilities:
• Deposits of customers
</pre>
  </div>

<p>
When a bank creates a loan, it creates a deposit.
No central bank money is involved at that moment.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Test your intuition</h3>

<p>
When a commercial bank issues a loan,
where does the new deposit come from?

<h3>Why control is indirect</h3>

<p>
Central banks influence interest rates,
liquidity conditions and regulations.
But they do not decide who gets loans
or how much money banks create.
</p>

<p>
Money creation is decentralized.
Control is indirect.
Instability is structural.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>You have now seen the mechanism</h3>

<p>
Money appears and disappears through balance sheets.
Not through preferences.
Not through equilibrium conditions.
</p>

<p>
Once banks are included,
financial crises stop being mysterious.
