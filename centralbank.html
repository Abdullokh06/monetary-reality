<h2>The central bank does not create money for the public</h2>

<p>
This is where confusion usually peaks.
People assume the central bank "prints money"
and hands it to the economy.
</p>

<p>
That is not what central banks do. Have you ever heard about M0 or M1?
</p>

<h3>What the central bank actually creates</h3>

<p>
The central bank creates <strong>reserves</strong>.
Reserves exist only between banks and the central bank.
Of course the central bank prints money physically, but not all the time.
</p>

    <div class="box">
      <strong>Central bank</strong>
<pre>
Assets | Liabilities
----------------------
Bonds  | Reserves +100
</pre>
    </div>

      <div class="box">
        <strong>Commercial bank</strong>
  <pre>
Assets        | Liabilities
---------------------------
Reserves +100 | Equity
</pre>
      </div>

  </div>

<p>
Reserves are not deposits.
Households and firms cannot use reserves to pay each other.
</p>

<h3>Where money for the public comes from</h3>

<p>
Money used by households and firms appears
when commercial banks issue loans.
</p>

<p>
The central bank is not involved in this process directly.
</p>

<p>
Banks do not wait for reserves to lend.
They lend first — and obtain reserves later if needed.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Test your intuition</h3>

<p>
A commercial bank issues a loan.
What role does the central bank play <em>at that moment</em>?

<h3>Why this distinction matters</h3>

<p>
If money were created by the central bank,
credit cycles would be policy accidents.
</p>

<p>
But if money is created by commercial banks,
instability is endogenous.
</p>

<p>
Crises are not surprises.
They are balance-sheet dynamics.
