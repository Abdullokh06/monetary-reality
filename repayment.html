<h2>What happens when the loan is repaid?</h2>

        <pre>
BANK                     BORROWER
Assets | Liabilities     Assets | Liabilities
Loan 0  | Deposit 0      Deposit 0 | Loan 0
        </pre>
        
<p>
When the borrower repays the loan, both the loan and the deposit disappear.
No money is transferred elsewhere.
The balance sheets contract symmetrically.
</p>

<p>
Money is not conserved like physical objects.
It is created and destroyed through accounting operations.
</p>

<h3>Test your intuition</h3>
<p>
A loan is repaid in full. What happens to money?
