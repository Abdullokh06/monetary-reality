        <p>Reading money through balance sheets</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p><strong>Modern economic models an economy without banks.</strong><br>
        <strong>that is why financial crises keep repeating.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Money is not transferred between agents.<br>
        It is created by banks - an institutional fact visible in balance sheets,<br>
        yet largely absent from economic models.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site uses publicly available balance sheet data<br>
            from central bank and financial institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            It does not provide financial advice. <br>
            It does not forecast markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its purpose is to reconstruct how money is created <br>
            within the banking system.

        <h2>Banks are not intermadiaries.</h2>
        <p>
            Standart macroeconomic models treat money
            as a circulating object between agents -
            household,firms and the state - while
            excluding banks as balance-sheet creators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Banks appear only as intermediaries - transferring existing money
            from savers to borrowers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In reality, banks do something fundametally different.
            They create money when they issue loans.
        </p>
        <p>
            If banks are excluded from the model,
            the mechanism of money creation disappears.
        </p>
        <h3> How a loan creates money?</h3>
        <pre>
Bank balance sheet after loan issuance:

Assets            | Liabilities
------------------|----------------
Loan +100         | Deposit +100
</pre>
        <p><em>
            A bank does not lend existing deposits.
            It creates new money when it issues a loan.
        </em></p>
         <hr>
        <h2>Why balance sheets matter?</h2>
        <p>Economic models usually focus on flows: income, spending, investment.
        Balance sheets, however, record stocks: assets, liabilities and equity.
        Money is soehow a stock, not a flow.
        If balance sheets are ignored, money itself becomes invisible.
        </p>
        <h3>Flows vs stocks.</h3>
        <p>
            Macroeconomic textbooks describe the economy as a circulation of money.
            But circulation diagrams hide the institutiona structure that creates money.
            Balance sheets make this structure explicit.
        </p>
        <h3>Two ways to represent the economy</h3>

<pre>
FLOW-BASED VIEW (standard models)

Households  --->  Firms
     ^              |
     |              v
   Wages         Investment

Money circulates between agents.
Banks are omitted or reduced to intermediaries.


BALANCE-SHEET VIEW (institutional reality)

Households        Banks
 Deposits  <---  Loans
                    |
                    v
              Balance sheets

Money appears as a bank liability.
Creation and destruction are accounting events.
