        <p><strong>Modern economic models an economy without banks.</strong><br>
        <strong>that is why financial crises keep repeating.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Money is not transferred between agents.<br>
        It is created by banks - an institutional fact visible in balance sheets,<br>

        <p>
            This site uses publicly available balance sheet data<br>

        <h2>Banks are not intermadiaries.</h2>
        <p>
            Standart macroeconomic models treat money
            as a circulating object between agents -
            household,firms and the state - while
            excluding banks as balance-sheet creators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Banks appear only as intermediaries - transferring existing money
            from savers to borrowers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In reality, banks do something fundametally different.
            They create money when they issue loans.
        </p>
        <p>
            If banks are excluded from the model,
            the mechanism of money creation disappears.

        <h2>Why balance sheets matter?</h2>
        <p>Economic models usually focus on flows: income, spending, investment.
        Balance sheets, however, record stocks: assets, liabilities and equity.
        Money is soehow a stock, not a flow.
        If balance sheets are ignored, money itself becomes invisible.
        </p>
        <h3>Flows vs stocks.</h3>
        <p>
            Macroeconomic textbooks describe the economy as a circulation of money.
            But circulation diagrams hide the institutiona structure that creates money.
            Balance sheets make this structure explicit.
        </p>
        <h3>Two ways to represent the economy</h3>

<pre>
FLOW-BASED VIEW (standard models)

Households  --->  Firms
     ^              |
     |              v
   Wages         Investment

Money circulates between agents.
Banks are omitted or reduced to intermediaries.


BALANCE-SHEET VIEW (institutional reality)

Households        Banks
 Deposits  <---  Loans
                    |
                    v
              Balance sheets

Money appears as a bank liability.
Creation and destruction are accounting events.
</pre>
        <p><em>
            Standart models focus on flows between agents.
            Balance sheets reveal the instituions that create money.
        </em></p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Money is an accounting fact</h2>
        <p>
        Money is not a theoretical construct.
        It is an accounting entry recorded on balance sheets.
        Every unit of money exists as a liability of the banking system.
        This is not a hypothesis - it is a fact documented by central banks.
        </p> 
            <h3>Central bank balance sheets</h3>
            <p>
                Central banks publish detailed balance sheets.
                These documents show how money enters the economy,
                how it is transformed through the banking system
                and how it is ultimately extinguished.
            </p>
        <p>
            This project relies exclusively on publicly available data
            from central banks and international institutions.
            No assumptions about behavior are required.
            The structure of money is visible in the accountins themselves.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What models assume and what they ommit</h2>
        <p>
            Most macroeconomic models do not deny exostence of banks.
            They simply abstract from them
            Bnaks are reduced to passive intermediaries
            and the act of money creation is excluded by assumption.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, money appaers as an exogenous variable,
            not as an outcome of institutional processes.
            Crises then appear as shocks,
            rather than as consequences of balance sheet dynamics
        </p>
        <h3>Absence as an assumption</h3>
        <p>
            What is absent from a model is often more important
            than what is explicity included.
            When banks are excluded,
            credit-driven expansions and contractions
            cannot appear endogenously.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>If banks are omitted, crises become mysterious</h2>
        <p>
            In standart macroeconomic models,
            financial crises appear as external shock.
            Something unexpected happens
            and the system deviates from equilibrium.
        </p>
        <p>
            But if banks create money through credit,
            then expansions and contractions of balance sheets
            are not shocks.
            They are the normal dynamics of the system.
        </p>
        <h3>Crises are not anomalies</h3>
        <p>
            When credit grows faster than incomes,
            balance sheets stretch.
            When repayment dominates new lending,
            money disappears.
            In such a system, instability is not an exception -
            it is a structual outcome.
        </p>

        <h2>Try to model money without banks</h2>
        <p>
            Assume an economy without banks.
            Try to explain how money enters the system,
            how it expands
            and how it disappears.

            <li>How does money increase without ptior savings?</li>
            <li>What happens to money when loans are repaid?</li>
            <li>How can a crisis emerge without balance sheets?</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>There is only one place where money can appear</h2>
        <p>
            On a balance sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not in preferences.
            Not in utility functions.
            Not in equilibrium conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            If money is nowhere on the balance sheet,
            it does not exist in the model
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>See it. Argue with it. Test it.</h2>
        <p>
            Understading money requires more than reading.
            It requires seeing structures, challenging assumptions
            and confronting theory with accounting reality.

        <h3>1. Build the system yourself</h3>
        <p>
            Start with a simple economy.
            Add households, firms and decide whether to include baks.
            Watch what becomes possible and what disappears.

        <h3>2. Argue with a standart macroeconomist</h3>
        <p>
            Most economists do not deny banks.
            They abstract from them.
            This assistant defends the standart framework.
            Your task is to challenge it.

        <h3>3. Confront theory with balance sheets</h3>
        <p> logic is clear,
        real balance sheets leave little room for interpretation.
