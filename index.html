        <h2>Why banks matter?</h2>
        <p>
            Most economic models describe an economy where money
            moves between household, firms and the state.
        </p>
        <p>
            Banks appear only as intermediaries - transferring existing money
            from savers to borrowers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In reality, banks do something fundametally different.
            They create money when they issue loans.
        </p>
        <p>
            If banks are excluded from the model,
            the mechanism of money creation disappears.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site uses publicly available balance sheet data<br>
            from central bank and financial institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            It does not provide financial advice. <br>
            It does not forecast markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its purpose is to reconstruct how money is created <br>
            within the banking system.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Modern economic models an economy without banks.</strong><br>
            <strong>That is why financial crises keep repeating.</strong></p>
        <p>Money is not transferred between agents.<br>
        It is crated by banks - an institutional fact visible in balance sheets,<br>
        yet largely absent from economic models.
