        <p><strong>Modern economic models an economy without banks.</strong><br>
        <strong>that is why financial crises keep repeating.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Money is not transferred between agents.<br>
        It is created by banks - an institutional fact visible in balance sheets,<br>
        yet largely absent from economic models.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site uses publicly available balance sheet data<br>
            from central bank and financial institutions.

            It does not provide financial advice. <br>
            It does not forecast markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its purpose is to reconstruct how money is created <br>
            within the banking system.

        <h2>Banks are not intermadiaries.</h2>
        <p>
            Standart macroeconomic models treat money
            as a circulating object between agents -
            household,firms and the state - while
            excluding banks as balance-sheet creators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Banks appear only as intermediaries - transferring existing money
            from savers to borrowers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In reality, banks do something fundametally different.
            They create money when they issue loans.
        </p>
        <p>
            If banks are excluded from the model,
            the mechanism of money creation disappears.
